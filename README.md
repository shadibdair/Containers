# Containers
Practicing docker, containers, etc..


-  containers (unlike hypervisors) run in user space
on top of an operating systemâ€™s kernel.
- As a result, container virtualization is often
called operating system-level virtualization.
- Container technology allows multiple isolated user
space instances to be run on a single host.
